		<p style="color:white">Waheeda Rehman (born 3 February 1938) is an Indian actress and dancer who has appeared in mainly Hindi films, as well as Telugu, Tamil, Bengali and Malayalam films. She is noted for her contributions to different genres of films and different roles from the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Her accolades consist of a National Film Award, two Filmfare Awards out of eight nominations, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and the Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality. Throughout her career, she has been frequently cited as one of Bollywood's "most beautiful" actresses by various media outlets, a title for which she has received substantial publicity.</p>
		<p style="color:white"><b><i>Despite winning the National Film Award for Best Actress for portraying a clanswoman in love with a separate clansman in Reshma Aur Shera (1971), her career came to a standstill when she was reduced to motherly, supporting roles in films. Rehman's notable performances in the 1970s are Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Namkeen (1982) and Lamhe (1991), and the latter film became her last film credit in the next 12 years until 2002, where she returned to the film industry.</i></b></p>

		<p style="color:white">Rehman began her career in films in the mid-1950s, usually dancing in item numbers. Her film debut occurred in the Telugu film Rojulu Maraayi (1955), in which she was encouraged by the producer of the film to join the cast, despite hesitance from her mother. It was a success, becoming a channel for more offers from filmmakers to Rehman. She was featured in Jayasimha (1955) by the side of veteran actor NT Rama Rao. Kaalam Maari Pochu (1956) and the first full-length colour Tamil film Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956).Besides Kala Bazar, Rehman acted in three other films in 1960, which were Ek Phool Char Kaante, Girlfriend, and Chaudhvin Ka Chand. The last film was another partnership between Rehman and Dutt, and was the fourth-highest grossing Hindi film of 1961. It was considered a "saving" point in Dutt's career, after their last collaboration, Kaagaz Ke Phool, had a horrendous run at the box office. It also represented the strained relationship of the duo. Dutt's existing marriage 			   and her film success with other directors caused them to drift apart personally and professionally, although they continued to work together into the 1960s. Their last movie together was the drama Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962), starring Dutt, Meena Kumari, Rehman and Rehman herself in a supporting role, and the movie was a flop financially but was lauded[19] internationally by critics. The film presented Rehman her first Filmfare nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress,[20] and the movie itself received nominations for the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars.[21] Rehman and Dutt finally broke away in 1963, and a year later, Dutt was found dead on 10 October 1964 in Mumbai, reportedly from an overdose mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol.
		   The actress began to experiment with her roles when she ventured into Bengali film-making with Satyajit Ray's film Abhijan in 1962. As the years went on, she began to taste higher success when she was offered the leading actress roles in films and played parts that were deemed as unconventional for the typical Bollywood actress.[22] Rehman played a murder suspect in Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), a girl embroiled in a sibling feud in Rakhi (1962) and an infertile woman in Ek Dil Sau Afsane (1963).
		   As a leading lady, she also started to star opposite of many familiar faces of Hindi Cinema; Sunil Dutt in Mujhe Jeene Do (1962), Nirupa Roy in Kaun Apna Kaun Paraya (1963), and Biswajit in the horror film Kohraa (1964), Majboor (1964), and the psychological-thriller Bees Saal Baad (1962)â€”the latter becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film of 1962.</p>
